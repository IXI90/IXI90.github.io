## Reinforcement Learning 

This exciting part of Machine Learning deals with agents that have to take actions in a possibly unknown environment. Those agents try to maximize their personal utility (reward) by following a learned strategy (policy). In this series of posts, I will try to summarize my first experiences with RL. The overall goal of this series is to explain all concepts needed to understand the paper "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" (by V. Mnih et al.). Besides, the presented theoretical models will be used to create an agent that can play my first - still favourite - mobile phone game "Snake". I hope you enjoy the posts!      

### Markov Decision Processes

The majority of RL problems can be formalized using Markov Decision Processes (MDP). A MDP is a tuple $<  \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, Î³>$
